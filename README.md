# Encounter Coffee - E-Commerce Platform Documentation
## GitHub Copilot Optimization Guide

> **Purpose**: This README provides comprehensive context for GitHub Copilot to generate precise, production-ready code for the Encounter Coffee e-commerce platform with SEO optimization, UI/UX best practices, and integrated heatmap analytics.

> **⚠️ ARCHITECTURE NOTE**: The website is fully developed in **WordPress** (pure code), but the e-commerce functionality (product catalog, cart, checkout) is integrated as an **iframe** embedded within WordPress HTML pages. This is a hybrid architecture where WordPress manages content, SEO, and storytelling, while the external e-commerce platform (embedded via iframe) handles transactions.

## �🛠 Tech Stack

### Core Platform
```yaml
CMS: WordPress 6.4+ (Content Management)
E-Commerce: External Platform (Embedded via iframe in WordPress pages)
Architecture: Hybrid - WordPress frontend + iframe e-commerce integration
PHP Version: 8.1+
MySQL: 8.0+ (WordPress database)
Web Server: Apache 2.4+ or Nginx 1.20+
```

### Architecture Overview
**Important**: The website is fully developed in WordPress (pure code), but the e-commerce functionality is integrated as an **iframe** embedded within WordPress HTML pages. This hybrid approach allows:
- **WordPress handles**: Content pages, blog, storytelling, grower profiles, SEO, navigation
- **iframe e-commerce handles**: Product catalog, cart, checkout, payment processing, order management
- **Seamless visual integration** while maintaining separation of concerns

### iframe E-Commerce Integration
```yaml
Integration Method: HTML iframe element embedded in WordPress pages
Communication: PostMessage API for cross-origin messaging
Responsive Handling: JavaScript-based dynamic iframe resizing
Styling: CSS to match WordPress theme aesthetics
Security: CSP headers, iframe sandboxing, HTTPS enforcement
E-Commerce Platform: [Specify: Shopify, WooCommerce standalone, Custom, etc.]
```

### Benefits of iframe Architecture
- ✅ **Separation of Concerns**: WordPress focuses on content, external platform handles transactions
- ✅ **Security**: PCI compliance managed by e-commerce platform
- ✅ **Flexibility**: Can swap e-commerce platforms without WordPress rebuild
- ✅ **Performance**: E-commerce platform optimized independently
- ✅ **Maintenance**: Updates to shop don't affect WordPress core

### Considerations
- ⚠️ **Cross-Origin Communication**: Requires PostMessage API implementation
- ⚠️ **SEO**: Product pages may need API integration for server-side rendering
- ⚠️ **Analytics**: Event tracking requires iframe-to-parent messaging
- ⚠️ **Styling Consistency**: iframe content must match WordPress theme

CSS Framework: Bootstrap 5.3.x (already in use)
CSS Preprocessor: SASS/SCSS
Build Tool: Gulp or Webpack

```

### Hosting Environment
```yaml
Hosting: Recommended - SiteGround, WP Engine, or Kinsta

```

### Development Tools
```yaml

  display: block;
  margin-top: $spacing-sm;
  font-size: 0.875rem;
  color: $color-error;
}
```

### Layout Patterns

#### Grid System
```scss
.container {
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 1200px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 0 $spacing-lg;
  
  @media (max-width: 768px) {
    padding: 0 $spacing-md;
  }
}

.row {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  margin: 0 (-$spacing-md);
}

.col {
  flex: 1;
  padding: 0 $spacing-md;
}

// Responsive columns
@for $i from 1 through 12 {
  .col-#{$i} {
    flex: 0 0 calc(#{$i / 12 * 100%});
    max-width: calc(#{$i / 12 * 100%});
  }
}
```

#### Section Spacing
```scss
.section {
  padding: $spacing-4xl 0;
  
  @media (max-width: 768px) {
    padding: $spacing-3xl 0;
  }
  
  &--hero {
    padding: calc($spacing-4xl * 1.5) 0;
  }
  
  &--compact {
    padding: $spacing-3xl 0;
  }
}
```

### Interaction Guidelines

#### Transitions
```scss
// Standard transition timing
$transition-fast: 0.15s ease;
$transition-normal: 0.3s ease;
$transition-slow: 0.5s ease;

// Common transition patterns
.hover-lift {
  transition: transform $transition-normal, box-shadow $transition-normal;
  
  &:hover {
    transform: translateY(-4px);
    box-shadow: 0 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);
  }
}

.fade-in {
  animation: fadeIn 0.5s ease-in;
}

@keyframes fadeIn {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(20px);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}
```

#### Loading Indicators
```scss
.loading-spinner {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 40px;
  height: 40px;
  border: 4px solid $color-border-light;      // Light gold border
  border-top-color: $color-accent-orange;     // Orange spinner #E69E2C
  border-radius: 50%;
  animation: spin 0.8s linear infinite;
  
  &--navy {
    border-top-color: $color-secondary-navy;  // Navy variant #2F4466
  }
}

@keyframes spin {
  to { transform: rotate(360deg); }
}
```

### Heatmap Dashboard Page Implementation

#### Create Custom Admin Page with Analytics Link
```php
/**
 * Add Analytics Dashboard menu item
 */
function ec_add_analytics_menu() {
    add_menu_page(
        'Analytics Dashboard',           // Page title
        'Analytics',                     // Menu title
        'manage_options',                // Capability
        'ec-analytics-dashboard',        // Menu slug
        'ec_analytics_dashboard_page',   // Callback function
        'dashicons-chart-bar',           // Icon
        30                                // Position
    );
}
add_action( 'admin_menu', 'ec_add_analytics_menu' );

/**
 * Render Analytics Dashboard page
 */
function ec_analytics_dashboard_page() {
    // Get Clarity project URL from options
    $clarity_project_url = get_option( 'ec_clarity_project_url', 'https://clarity.microsoft.com/projects/view/YOUR_PROJECT_ID' );
    ?>
    <div class="wrap">

            margin-top: 20px;
        }
        .analytics-quick-links {
            background: #fff;
            padding: 20px;
            margin-bottom: 20px;

            border-radius: 4px;
        }
    </style>
    <?php
}
```

### Access Control Implementation

#### Role-Based Access
```php
/**
 * Restrict analytics dashboard to specific roles
 */
function ec_restrict_analytics_access() {
    if ( is_admin() && isset( $_GET['page'] ) && $_GET['page'] === 'ec-analytics-dashboard' ) {
        if ( ! current_user_can( 'manage_options' ) && ! current_user_can( 'shop_manager' ) ) {
            wp_die( __( 'You do not have permission to access this page.', 'encountercoffee' ) );
        }
    }
}
add_action( 'admin_init', 'ec_restrict_analytics_access' );
```

### Data Privacy & GDPR Compliance

#### Cookie Consent Integration
```php
/**
 * Load Clarity only after cookie consent
 */
function ec_conditional_clarity_tracking() {
    ?>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
            // Check if user has accepted analytics cookies
            if (getCookie('analytics_consent') === 'accepted') {
                loadClarityScript();
            }
        });
        
        function loadClarityScript() {
            (function(c,l,a,r,i,t,y){
                c[a]=c[a]||function(){(c[a].q=c[a].q||[]).push(arguments)};
                t=l.createElement(r);t.async=1;t.src="https://www.clarity.ms/tag/"+i;
                y=l.getElementsByTagName(r)[0];y.parentNode.insertBefore(t,y);
            })(window, document, "clarity", "script", "YOUR_CLARITY_PROJECT_ID");
        }
        
        function getCookie(name) {
            const value = `; ${document.cookie}`;
            const parts = value.split(`; ${name}=`);
            if (parts.length === 2) return parts.pop().split(';').shift();
        }
    </script>
    <?php
}
add_action( 'wp_head', 'ec_conditional_clarity_tracking' );
```

### Event Tracking Configuration

#### Custom Events for E-Commerce Actions
```javascript
// Track Add to Cart
jQuery(document).on('added_to_cart', function(event, fragments, cart_hash, button) {
    if (typeof clarity === 'function') {
        clarity('set', 'product_added', button.data('product_id'));
        clarity('event', 'add_to_cart');
    }
});

// Track Checkout Started
if (jQuery('body').hasClass('woocommerce-checkout')) {
    if (typeof clarity === 'function') {
        clarity('event', 'checkout_started');
    }
}

// Track Purchase Completed
if (jQuery('body').hasClass('woocommerce-order-received')) {
    if (typeof clarity === 'function') {
        clarity('event', 'purchase_completed');
    }
}

// Track Product Views
if (jQuery('body').hasClass('single-product')) {
    const productId = jQuery('input[name="product_id"]').val();
    if (typeof clarity === 'function') {
        clarity('set', 'product_viewed', productId);
        clarity('event', 'product_view');
    }

        echo '</div>';
    }
}
add_action( 'woocommerce_single_product_summary', 'ec_display_custom_fields', 25 );
```

### Performance Optimization

#### Image Lazy Loading
```php
/**
 * Enable native lazy loading for product images
 */
function ec_lazy_load_product_images( $html, $post_id ) {
    return str_replace( '<img', '<img loading="lazy"', $html );
}
add_filter( 'post_thumbnail_html', 'ec_lazy_load_product_images', 10, 2 );
```

#### Database Query Optimization
```php
/**
 * Optimize WooCommerce product queries
 */
function ec_optimize_product_queries( $query_args ) {
    if ( ! is_admin() ) {
        $query_args['no_found_rows'] = true;
        $query_args['update_post_meta_cache'] = false;
        $query_args['update_post_term_cache'] = false;
    }
    return $query_args;
}
add_filter( 'woocommerce_product_query', 'ec_optimize_product_queries' );
```

### Security Hardening

#### Disable XML-RPC
```php
add_filter( 'xmlrpc_enabled', '__return_false' );
```

#### Remove WordPress Version
```php
remove_action( 'wp_head', 'wp_generator' );
```

#### Limit Login Attempts (if not using plugin)
```php
/**
 * Track failed login attempts
 */
function ec_check_failed_logins( $username ) {
    $ip = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
    $transient_key = 'failed_login_' . md5( $ip );
    $failed_count = get_transient( $transient_key );
    
    if ( $failed_count >= 5 ) {
        wp_die( 'Too many failed login attempts. Please try again in 15 minutes.' );
    }
}
add_action( 'wp_login_failed', 'ec_check_failed_logins' );

function ec_reset_failed_logins( $username ) {
    $ip = $_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR'];
    delete_transient( 'failed_login_' . md5( $ip ) );
}
add_action( 'wp_login', 'ec_reset_failed_logins' );
```

// Generate meta tags for WooCommerce product page including dynamic product name, 
// category, price, and roast level. Target keyword: "specialty coffee beans online"
// Include Open Graph and Twitter Card markup. Max description length: 155 characters.
```

### UI Component Creation
```
// Build responsive product card component with 1:1 image ratio, hover lift effect,
// sale badge overlay, product title, origin label, price display, and add-to-cart button.
// Follow BEM naming convention and use CSS custom properties for colors/spacing.
// Support grid layouts of 2/3/4 columns with appropriate breakpoints.
```

### iframe Integration Implementation
```
// Create WordPress page template with responsive iframe container for e-commerce.
// Implement PostMessage API for height adjustment and cart count updates.
// Add loading spinner during iframe load. Style container to match site theme.
// Ensure HTTPS, proper CSP headers, and mobile-responsive iframe sizing.
```

### Schema Markup Generation
```
// Generate Product schema for coffee products with properties: name, image,
// description, SKU, brand (Encounter Coffee), price, currency, availability, aggregate rating.
// Data source: External e-commerce platform API or manual entry in WordPress.
// Include custom fields: roast level, region, grower name, tasting notes. Output as JSON-LD format.
```

### Heatmap Integration
```
// Create WordPress admin page for heatmap analytics dashboard with Microsoft Clarity embed.
// Include quick access buttons for heatmaps, session recordings, and full dashboard.
// Restrict access to administrators and shop managers only. Add custom styling.
```

### Form Validation
```
// Implement client-side validation for WordPress contact/inquiry forms with real-time feedback.
// Validate email format, phone number pattern, required fields. Show inline error messages
// with smooth animations. Prevent form submission until all validations pass.
// Note: E-commerce checkout validation handled within iframe by external platform.
```

### iframe Communication Handler
```
// Create PostMessage API communication system between WordPress and iframe e-commerce.
// Listen for events: cart updates, height changes, page navigation. Send user data for
// personalization. Implement dynamic iframe resizing based on content. Add fallback for
// PostMessage not supported. Log communication for debugging.
```

### Custom Gutenberg Block
```
// Build custom Gutenberg block "Featured Coffee Products" with options to select number
// of products, filter by category, choose layout (grid/carousel), and set columns.
// Include live preview in editor. Follow WordPress block development best practices.
```

### Performance Optimization
```
// Optimize WooCommerce product image loading with progressive JPEG, WebP format with fallback,
// native lazy loading, and blur-up placeholder technique. Implement responsive images with
// srcset. Ensure cumulative layout shift (CLS) score < 0.1.
```

### WordPress Email Template Customization
```
// Customize WordPress transactional email templates (contact form, inquiry, newsletter) with
// brand colors, logo header, and social media links. Ensure mobile responsive and email client
// compatibility (Gmail, Outlook, Apple Mail). Note: Order confirmation emails handled by
// external e-commerce platform within iframe.
```

## ✅ Code Quality Standards

### HTML Best Practices
- Use semantic HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`)
- Include proper ARIA labels for accessibility
- Use data attributes for JavaScript hooks instead of classes
- Ensure all images have descriptive `alt` attributes
- Maintain proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)

### CSS Best Practices
- Use BEM naming convention for maintainability
- Leverage CSS custom properties for theme values
- Mobile-first media queries
- Avoid `!important` declarations (use specificity correctly)
- Use flexbox/grid for layouts (avoid floats)
- Implement CSS containment for performance

### JavaScript Best Practices
- Use ES6+ syntax (const/let, arrow functions, template literals)
- Minimize jQuery usage; prefer vanilla JavaScript
- Implement error handling with try/catch blocks
- Use event delegation for dynamic content
- Debounce/throttle expensive operations (scroll, resize)
- Load scripts asynchronously when possible

### PHP/WordPress Best Practices
- Follow WordPress Coding Standards
- Escape all output with `esc_html()`, `esc_attr()`, `esc_url()`
- Sanitize all input with appropriate functions
- Use nonces for form security
- Implement proper capability checks
- Use transients for caching expensive queries
- Prefix all custom functions/classes with `ec_`

### Accessibility Standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Color contrast ratio minimum 4.5:1 for text
- Focus indicators visible on all interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support for all functionality
- Screen reader compatible with proper ARIA attributes
- Forms with associated labels
- Alternative text for all meaningful images

### Performance Standards
- Page weight target: < 2MB total
- JavaScript bundle: < 500KB
- CSS bundle: < 100KB
- Images: WebP format with JPEG fallback, optimized
- HTTP requests: < 50 per page
- Server response time: < 200ms (TTFB)
