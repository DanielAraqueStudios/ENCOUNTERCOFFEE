## �🛠 Tech Stack

### Core Platform
```yaml
Base Template: TemplateMo 587 (Tiya Golf Club) - Adapted for Encounter Coffee
Architecture: Static HTML/CSS/JavaScript + iframe e-commerce integration
HTML: HTML5 semantic markup
CSS: Bootstrap 5.3.x + Custom CSS (templatemo-tiya-golf-club.css)
JavaScript: Vanilla JS + jQuery 3.x
Fonts: Google Fonts (DM Sans)
Icons: Bootstrap Icons
Web Server: Apache 2.4+ or Nginx 1.20+ (for static hosting)
Hosting: GitHub Pages, Netlify, Vercel, or traditional web hosting
```

### Architecture Overview
**Important**: The website is built on a **static HTML template** (customized TemplateMo 587), with e-commerce functionality integrated as an **iframe** embedded within HTML pages. This hybrid approach allows:
- **Static HTML handles**: Content pages, storytelling, grower profiles, SEO, navigation, events
- **iframe e-commerce handles**: Product catalog, cart, checkout, payment processing, order management
- **Seamless visual integration** while maintaining separation of concerns
- **No backend/database required** for content - pure frontend with optional form handlers

### iframe E-Commerce Integration
```yaml
Integration Method: HTML iframe element embedded in static HTML page (shop.html)
Communication: PostMessage API for cross-origin messaging
Responsive Handling: JavaScript-based dynamic iframe resizing
Styling: CSS to match template aesthetics (Bootstrap 5 + custom CSS)
Security: CSP headers, iframe sandboxing, HTTPS enforcement
E-Commerce Platform: [Specify: Shopify, WooCommerce standalone, Custom, etc.]
Form Handling: Formspree, Netlify Forms, or custom backend API
```

### Benefits of iframe Architecture
- ✅ **Separation of Concerns**: Static site focuses on content/branding, external platform handles transactions
- ✅ **Security**: PCI compliance managed by e-commerce platform
- ✅ **Flexibility**: Can swap e-commerce platforms without static site rebuild
- ✅ **Performance**: E-commerce platform optimized independently
- ✅ **Maintenance**: Updates to shop don't affect static site content

### Considerations
- ⚠️ **Cross-Origin Communication**: Requires PostMessage API implementation

### Layout Patterns

#### Grid System
```scss
.container {
  width: 100%;
  max-width: 1200px;
  margin: 0 auto;
  padding: 0 $spacing-lg;
  
  @media (max-width: 768px) {
    padding: 0 $spacing-md;
  }
}

.row {
  display: flex;
  flex-wrap: wrap;
  margin: 0 (-$spacing-md);
}

.col {
  flex: 1;
  padding: 0 $spacing-md;
}

// Responsive columns
@for $i from 1 through 12 {
  .col-#{$i} {
    flex: 0 0 calc(#{$i / 12 * 100%});
    max-width: calc(#{$i / 12 * 100%});
  }
}
```

#### Section Spacing
```scss
.section {
  padding: $spacing-4xl 0;
  
  @media (max-width: 768px) {
    padding: $spacing-3xl 0;
  }
  
  &--hero {
    padding: calc($spacing-4xl * 1.5) 0;
  }
  
  &--compact {
    padding: $spacing-3xl 0;
  }
}
```

### Interaction Guidelines

#### Transitions
```scss
// Standard transition timing
$transition-fast: 0.15s ease;
$transition-normal: 0.3s ease;
$transition-slow: 0.5s ease;

// Common transition patterns
.hover-lift {
  transition: transform $transition-normal, box-shadow $transition-normal;
  
  &:hover {
    transform: translateY(-4px);
    box-shadow: 0 8px 24px rgba(0,0,0,0.15);
  }
}

.fade-in {
  animation: fadeIn 0.5s ease-in;
}

@keyframes fadeIn {
  from {
    opacity: 0;
    transform: translateY(20px);
  }
  to {
    opacity: 1;
    transform: translateY(0);
  }
}
```

#### Loading Indicators
```scss
.loading-spinner {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 40px;
  height: 40px;
  border: 4px solid $color-border-light;      // Light gold border
  border-top-color: $color-accent-orange;     // Orange spinner #E69E2C
  border-radius: 50%;
  animation: spin 0.8s linear infinite;
  
  &--navy {
    border-top-color: $color-secondary-navy;  // Navy variant #2F4466
  }
}

@keyframes spin {
  to { transform: rotate(360deg); }
}
```

### Heatmap Dashboard Page Implementation

#### Create Custom Admin Page with Analytics Link
```php
/**
 * Add Analytics Dashboard menu item
 */
function ec_add_analytics_menu() {
    add_menu_page(
        'Analytics Dashboard',           // Page title
        'Analytics',                     // Menu title
        'manage_options',                // Capability
        'ec-analytics-dashboard',        // Menu slug
        'ec_analytics_dashboard_page',   // Callback function
        'dashicons-chart-bar',           // Icon
        30                                // Position
    );
}
add_action( 'admin_menu', 'ec_add_analytics_menu' );

/**
 * Render Analytics Dashboard page
 */
function ec_analytics_dashboard_page() {
    // Get Clarity project URL from options
    $clarity_project_url = get_option( 'ec_clarity_project_url', 'https://clarity.microsoft.com/projects/view/YOUR_PROJECT_ID' );
    ?>

            border-radius: 4px;
        }
    </style>
    <?php
}
```

### Access Control Implementation

#### Role-Based Access
```php
/**
 * Restrict analytics dashboard to specific roles
 */
function ec_restrict_analytics_access() {
    if ( is_admin() && isset( $_GET['page'] ) && $_GET['page'] === 'ec-analytics-dashboard' ) {
        if ( ! current_user_can( 'manage_options' ) && ! current_user_can( 'shop_manager' ) ) {
            wp_die( __( 'You do not have permission to access this page.', 'encountercoffee' ) );
        }
    }
}
add_action( 'admin_init', 'ec_restrict_analytics_access' );
```

### Data Privacy & GDPR Compliance

#### Cookie Consent Integration
```php
/**
 * Load Clarity only after cookie consent
 */
function ec_conditional_clarity_tracking() {
    ?>
    <script type="text/javascript">
        document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
            // Check if user has accepted analytics cookies
            if (getCookie('analytics_consent') === 'accepted') {
                loadClarityScript();
            }
        });
        
        function loadClarityScript() {
            (function(c,l,a,r,i,t,y){
                c[a]=c[a]||function(){(c[a].q=c[a].q||[]).push(arguments)};
                t=l.createElement(r);t.async=1;t.src="https://www.clarity.ms/tag/"+i;
                y=l.getElementsByTagName(r)[0];y.parentNode.insertBefore(t,y);
            })(window, document, "clarity", "script", "YOUR_CLARITY_PROJECT_ID");
        }
        
        function getCookie(name) {
            const value = `; ${document.cookie}`;
            const parts = value.split(`; ${name}=`);
            if (parts.length === 2) return parts.pop().split(';').shift();
        }
    </script>
    <?php
}
add_action( 'wp_head', 'ec_conditional_clarity_tracking' );
```

### Event Tracking Configuration

#### Custom Events for E-Commerce Actions
```javascript
// Track Add to Cart
jQuery(document).on('added_to_cart', function(event, fragments, cart_hash, button) {
    if (typeof clarity === 'function') {
        clarity('set', 'product_added', button.data('product_id'));
        clarity('event', 'add_to_cart');
    }
});

// Track Checkout Started
if (jQuery('body').hasClass('woocommerce-checkout')) {
    if (typeof clarity === 'function') {
        clarity('event', 'checkout_started');
    }
}

// Track Purchase Completed
if (jQuery('body').hasClass('woocommerce-order-received')) {
    if (typeof clarity === 'function') {
        clarity('event', 'purchase_completed');
    }
}

// Track Product Views
if (jQuery('body').hasClass('single-product')) {
    const productId = jQuery('input[name="product_id"]').val();
    if (typeof clarity === 'function') {
        clarity('set', 'product_viewed', productId);
        clarity('event', 'product_view');

### Performance Optimization

#### Image Optimization and Lazy Loading
```javascript
/**
 * Optimize images with lazy loading and modern formats
 * File: js/image-optimization.js
 */
document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', function() {
    // Native lazy loading for all images
    const images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading="lazy"]');
    
    // Add intersection observer for older browsers fallback
    if ('IntersectionObserver' in window) {
        const imageObserver = new IntersectionObserver((entries, observer) => {
            entries.forEach(entry => {
                if (entry.isIntersecting) {
                    const img = entry.target;
                    if (img.dataset.src) {
                        img.src = img.dataset.src;
                        img.classList.remove('lazy');
                        observer.unobserve(img);
                    }
                }
            });
        });
        
        images.forEach(img => imageObserver.observe(img));
    }
    
    // WebP support detection
    function supportsWebP() {
        const canvas = document.createElement('canvas');
        return canvas.toDataURL('image/webp').indexOf('data:image/webp') === 0;
    }
    
    if (supportsWebP()) {
        document.documentElement.classList.add('webp-support');
    }
});
```

#### CSS and JavaScript Minification
```javascript
/**
 * Production build script for CSS/JS minification
 * File: build.js (Node.js script)
 */
const fs = require('fs');
const cleanCSS = require('clean-css');
const uglifyJS = require('uglify-js');

// Minify CSS
const cssInput = fs.readFileSync('css/encounter-custom.css', 'utf8');
const cssOutput = new cleanCSS({}).minify(cssInput);
fs.writeFileSync('css/encounter-custom.min.css', cssOutput.styles);

// Minify JavaScript
const jsFiles = [
    'js/products.js',
    'js/iframe-handler.js',
    'js/image-optimization.js'
];

jsFiles.forEach(file => {
    const jsInput = fs.readFileSync(file, 'utf8');
    const jsOutput = uglifyJS.minify(jsInput);
    const outputFile = file.replace('.js', '.min.js');
    fs.writeFileSync(outputFile, jsOutput.code);
});

console.log('Build complete!');
```

### Security Best Practices

#### Content Security Policy Headers
```html
<!-- Add to all HTML pages in <head> -->
<meta http-equiv="Content-Security-Policy" content="
    default-src 'self';
    script-src 'self' https://cdn.jsdelivr.net https://www.google-analytics.com;
    style-src 'self' 'unsafe-inline' https://fonts.googleapis.com;
    img-src 'self' data: https:;
    font-src 'self' https://fonts.gstatic.com;
    frame-src https://shop.encountercoffee.com https://www.youtube.com;
    connect-src 'self' https://shop.encountercoffee.com https://www.google-analytics.com;
">
```

#### Form Validation and Sanitization
```javascript
/**
 * Contact form validation and sanitization
 * File: js/form-validation.js
 */
const EC_FormValidation = {
    init: function() {
        const contactForm = document.getElementById('contactForm');
        if (contactForm) {
            contactForm.addEventListener('submit', this.handleSubmit.bind(this));
        }
    },
    
    handleSubmit: function(e) {
        e.preventDefault();
        
        const name = document.getElementById('name').value.trim();
        const email = document.getElementById('email').value.trim();
        const message = document.getElementById('message').value.trim();
        
        // Validate
        if (!this.validateName(name)) {
            this.showError('name', 'Please enter a valid name');
            return false;
        }
        
        if (!this.validateEmail(email)) {
            this.showError('email', 'Please enter a valid email address');
            return false;
        }
        
        if (!this.validateMessage(message)) {
            this.showError('message', 'Message must be at least 10 characters');
            return false;
        }
        
        // Submit via Formspree or Netlify Forms

## ✅ Code Quality Standards

### HTML Best Practices
- Use semantic HTML5 elements (`<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<article>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`)
- Include proper ARIA labels for accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliance)
- Use data attributes for JavaScript hooks instead of classes
- Ensure all images have descriptive `alt` attributes (important for coffee product imagery)
- Maintain proper heading hierarchy (h1 → h2 → h3)
- Validate HTML with W3C validator before deployment

### CSS Best Practices
- Use BEM naming convention for maintainability (.product-card__title)
- Leverage CSS custom properties for Encounter Coffee brand colors
- Mobile-first media queries (min-width approach)
- Avoid `!important` declarations (use specificity correctly)
- Use flexbox/grid for layouts (avoid floats)
- Implement CSS containment for performance on product grids
- Prefix custom classes with `ec-` to avoid conflicts

### JavaScript Best Practices
- Use ES6+ syntax (const/let, arrow functions, template literals)
- Minimize jQuery usage; prefer vanilla JavaScript for better performance
- Implement error handling with try/catch blocks
- Use event delegation for dynamic product content
- Debounce/throttle expensive operations (scroll, resize, filter)
- Load scripts asynchronously when possible (async/defer attributes)
- Namespace custom code under `EC_` object to avoid global pollution

### Static Site Development Standards
- Maintain consistent file structure and naming conventions
- Use relative paths for internal links (enables local testing)
- Separate concerns: HTML (structure), CSS (presentation), JS (behavior)
- Comment complex sections with clear explanations
- Keep JavaScript functions small and focused (single responsibility)
- Test on multiple browsers: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- Optimize for Core Web Vitals (LCP < 2.5s, FID < 100ms, CLS < 0.1)

### Accessibility Standards (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Color contrast ratio minimum 4.5:1 for text
- Focus indicators visible on all interactive elements
- Keyboard navigation support for all functionality
- Screen reader compatible with proper ARIA attributes
- Forms with associated labels
- Alternative text for all meaningful images

### Performance Standards
- Page weight target: < 2MB total
- JavaScript bundle: < 500KB
- CSS bundle: < 100KB
- Images: WebP format with JPEG fallback, optimized
- HTTP requests: < 50 per page
- Server response time: < 200ms (TTFB)
